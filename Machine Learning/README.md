# Machine Learning Project
 Project done as part of Introduction to AI & ML course in university for feature engineering and developing model to identify images as letters, non-letters & characters 
## Machine Learning

This part of project majorly focuses on the machine learning models to classify between different types of images such as letters, non-letters, finding out the accuracy of models. There's also implementation of cross-validating the data and checking their accuracy.
