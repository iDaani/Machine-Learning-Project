# Machine Learning Project
 Project done as part of Introduction to AI & ML course in university for feature engineering and developing model to identify images as letters, non-letters & characters 

The project is divided into two categories:

### Feature Anaylsis & Statistical Anaylsis 
In here, the dataset of images was created and we performed feature engineering on the dataset alongside doing statistical anaylsis - https://github.com/iDaani/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/Feature%20Engineering%20%26%20Statistical%20Analysis/README.md

### Machine Learning
In here, we focused on creating machine learning models to identify different types of dataset and classify them; furthermore record the accuracy - https://github.com/iDaani/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/README.md
